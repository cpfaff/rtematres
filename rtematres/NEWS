rtematres 0.3
==================

* updates to latest api version 1.4 which introduces an exact match of 
  datasets (task = fetch)

* introduces new smarter interface for search 
  - now embraces character search, default search, and search in notes

* introduces new annotation features. 
  - These allow to find common concepts for contents in data frames
  - It searches for the terms on tematres and makes a guess whats in 
    your columns. It returns a annotation metadata object that can be used 
    to start build up more sophisticated metadata automatically later on.
  - adds a few conversion and checking tools for iso dates. They try to 
    convert to ISO 8601 format for a few formats and give you feedback if
    a date in ISO 8601 is in a column.

      as.IsoDate(testdata_with_dates$date)
      is.IsoDate(testdata_with_dates$date)

rtematres 0.2
==================

* introduces a convenience function for all tasks that takes strings as 
  input only. So you do not have to transform the term you are looking
  for into an id to communicate with the server anymore. 

rtematres 0.1
==================

* Initial version of rtematres. Introduces the base api functions
* Also comes with helpers to convert an id to a key and vice versa 
* Higher functions that leverage the search for terms, relations to upper 
  and narrower keywords as well as desriptions.
